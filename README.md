# Hey, I'm Rupak 👋

Junior Full Stack Developer | MERN Stack | Learning in Public

## Where I'm At Right Now

8 months into my web development journey, and honestly? It's been a wild ride. Started from tutorial hell, made it through a 3-month internship, and now working as a junior full stack developer. Still Googling "how to center a div" sometimes, but also shipping real features to production.

**Current Reality Check:**
- 💼 Working as a Junior Full Stack Developer
- 🎓 3 months of internship experience under my belt
- 🚀 Comfortable with MERN stack, but still learning something new every day
- 🐛 Getting better at debugging (and creating fewer bugs...  hopefully)
- 📚 That tutorial I bookmarked? Yeah, I'll get to it...  eventually

## What I Actually Work With

**Day-to-Day Tools:**
- Frontend: React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS (Flexbox still wins over Grid for me)
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MySql
- Version Control: Git (yes, I've force-pushed to main before...  once...  but in personal project)

## Let's Connect

I'm always down to chat about code, collaborate on projects, or share war stories from the trenches of junior dev life.
